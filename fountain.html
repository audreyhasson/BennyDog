    <p>Today was a very good day. I mean, for me it was a good day. I really like jumping in fountains. It might not have been as good of a day for Dad, though. Especially when the fountain walls were too tall for me to jump out. It’s funny how those things work out sometimes. We had just been visiting my sister Kayleigh at “college” and it was a really hot day. So all in all, I think Mom and Dad should’ve expected me to go for the fountain. No harm, no foul. Dad just got a little bit wet hauling me out. Afterwards, I got a stick!!</p>
